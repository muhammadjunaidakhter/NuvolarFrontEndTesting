  Scenario Outline: Test add to cart functionality

    Given I am on the Amazon homepage "<footertext>"
    When I enter "<text_for_men>" in search box and click search icon
    And I add product to cart with "<quantity2>"
    Then I open cart and verify total price and quantity "<quantity2>" for men
    When I enter "<text_for_women>" in search box and click search icon
    And I add product to cart with "<quantity1>"
    Then I open cart and verify total price for quantity "<quantity1>" for women
    When I change the quantity for first selected item from "<quantity2>" to "<quantity1>"
    Then I verify total price and quantity "<quantity1>" are changed correctly
